        <span>Ryemeadows' Farmhouse was in evil case:</span>

        <span>Its master, Nicholas Gray, was like to die.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He lay in bed, watching the windy sky,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where all the rooks were homing on slow wings,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Cawing, or blackly circling in enormous rings.</span>

    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>With a sick brain he watched them; then he took</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Paper and pen, and wrote in straggling hand</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>(Like spider's legs, so much his fingers shook)</span>
      </div>

        <span>Word to the friends who held the adjoining land,</span>

        <span>Bidding them come; no more he could command</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His fingers twitching to the feebling blood;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>While all his life's thoughts surged about his brain:</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Memories and pictures clear, and faces known--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Long dead, perhaps; he was a child again,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Treading a threshold in the dark alone.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then back the present surged, making him moan.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He asked if Keir had come yet. "No," they said.</span>

    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The names like live things wandered in his mind:</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Keir of the Foxholes"; but his brain was blind,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A blind old alley in the storm of the year,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Baffling the traveller life with "No way here,"</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>For all his lantern raised; life would not tread</span>
      </div>

        <span>"I'll hold to that," he said; then footsteps stirred.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Down in the court a voice said, "Here they are,"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And one, "He's almost gone." The sick man heard.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Oh God, be quick," he moaned. "Only one word.</span>

        <span>Keir! Occleve! Let them come. Why don't they come?</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Death had him by the throat; his wrath was tamed.</span>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The friends came in; a creaking ran across the floor.</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Now, Nick, how goes it, man?" said Occleve. "Oh,"</span>

        <span>Still troubled in his mind, the sick man tossed.</span>

        <span>Mary and Michael wed, but fates are crossed,</span>

        <span>Old passion for her made his being smart,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Rankling within. Her thought for Michael ran</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Like glory and like poison through his inner man.</span>

        <span>A whistling reached them from the Hall House side;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Climbing, the whistler came. A brown owl cried.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The whistler paused to answer, sending far</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That haunting, hunting note. The echoes laughed Aha!</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Something about the calling made them start.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Again the owl note laughed; the ringing cry</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Made the blood quicken within Mary's heart.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Like a dead leaf a brown owl floated by.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Michael?" said Lion. "Hush." An owl's reply</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Came down the wind; they waited; then the man,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Content, resumed his walk, a merry song began.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Michael," they cried together. "Michael, you?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Who calls?" the singer answered. "Where away?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Is that you, Mary?" Then with glad halloo</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The singer ran to meet them on the way.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It was their Michael; in the moonlight grey,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They made warm welcome; under tossing boughs,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They met and told the fate darkening Ryemeadows' House.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>As they returned at speed their comrade spoke</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Strangely and lightly of his coming home,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Saying that leaving France had been a joke,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But that events now proved him wise to come.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Down the steep 'scarpment to the house they clomb,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And Michael faltered in his pace; they heard</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>How dumb rebellion in the much-wronged cattle stirred.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And as they came, high, from the sick man's room,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Old Gray burst out a-singing of the light</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Streaming upon him from the outer gloom,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>As his eyes dying gave him mental sight.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Triumphing swords," he carolled, "in the bright;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Oh fire, Oh beauty fire," and fell back dead.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Occleve took Michael up to kneel beside the bed.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So the night passed; the noisy wind went down;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The half-burnt moon her starry trackway rode.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then the first fire was lighted in the town,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And the first carter stacked his early load.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Upon the farm's drawn blinds the morning glowed;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And down the valley, with little clucks and trills,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The dancing waters danced by dancing daffodils.</span>

        <span>They buried Gray; his gear was sold; his farm</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Passed to another tenant. Thus men go;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The dropped sword passes to another arm,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And different waters in the river flow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His two old faithful friends let Michael know</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His father's ruin and their promise. Keir</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Brought him to stay at Foxholes till a path was clear.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>There, when the sale was over, all three met</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To talk about the future, and to find</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Upon what project Michael's heart was set.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Gentle the two old men were, thoughtful, kind.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They urged the youth to speak his inmost mind,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>For they would compass what he chose; they told</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>How he might end his training; they would find the gold.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Thanks, but I cannot," Michael said. He smiled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Cannot. They've kicked me out. I've been expelled;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Kicked out for good and all for being wild.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They stopped our evening leave, and I rebelled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I am a gentle soul until compelled,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And then I put my ears back. The old fool</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Said that my longer presence might inflame the school.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"And I am glad, for I have had my fill</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of farming by the book with those old fools,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Exhausted talkatives whose blood is still,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Who strive to bind a living man with rules.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>This fettered kind of life, these laws, these schools,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>These codes, these checks, what are they but the clogs</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Made by collected sheep to mortify the dogs?</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"And I have had enough of them; and now</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I make an end of them. I want to go</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Somewhere where man has never used a plough,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Nor ever read a book; where clean winds blow,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And passionate blood is not its owner's foe,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And land is for the asking for it. There</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Man can create a life and have the open air.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"The River Plate's the country. There, I know,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A man like me can thrive. There, on the range,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The cattle pass like tides; they ebb and flow,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And life is changeless in unending change,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And one can ride all day, and all day strange,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Strange, never trodden, fenceless, waiting there,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To feed unending cattle for the men who dare.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"There I should have a chance; this land's too old."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Old Occleve grunted at the young man's mood;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Keir, who was losing money, thought him bold,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And thought the scheme for emigration good.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He said that, if he wished to go, he should.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>South to the pampas, there to learn the trade.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Old Occleve thought it mad, but no objection made.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So it was settled that the lad should start,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A place was found for him, a berth was taken;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And Michael's beauty plucked at Mary's heart,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And now the fabric of their lives was shaken:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>For now the hour's nearness made love waken</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>In Michael's heart for Mary. Now Time's guile</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Granted her passionate prayer, nor let her see his smile.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Granted his greatest gifts; a night time came</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>When the two walking down the water learned</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That life till then had only been a name;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Love had unsealed their spirits: they discerned.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mutely, at moth time there, their spirits yearned.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"I shall be gone three years, dear soul," he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Dear, will you wait for me?" "I will," replied the maid.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So troth was pledged between them. Keir received</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Michael as Mary's suitor, feeling sure</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That the lad's fortunes would be soon retrieved,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Having a woman's promise as a lure.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The three years' wait would teach them to endure.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He bade them love and prosper and be glad.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And fast the day drew near that was to take the lad.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Cowslips had come along the bubbling brook,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Cowslips and oxlips rare, and in the wood</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The many-blossomed stalks of bluebells shook;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The outward beauty fed their mental mood.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Thought of the parting stabbed her as he wooed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Walking the brook with her, and day by day,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The precious fortnight's grace dropped, wasted, slipped away.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Till only one clear day remained to her:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>One whole clear, precious day, before he sailed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Some forty hours, no more, to minister</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To months of bleakness before which she quailed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mist rose along the brook; the corncrake railed;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Dim red the sunset burned. He bade her come</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Into the wood with him; they went, the night came dumb.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Still as high June, the very water's noise</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Seemed but a breathing of the earth; the flowers</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Stood in the dim like souls without a voice.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The wood's conspiracy of occult powers</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Drew all about them, and for hours on hours</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>No murmur shook the oaks, the stars did house</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Their lights like lamps upon those never-moving boughs.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Under their feet the woodland sloped away</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Down to the valley, where the farmhouse lights</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Were sparks in the expanse the moon made grey.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>June's very breast was bare this night of nights.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Moths blundered up against them, greys and whites</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Moved on the darkness where the moths were out,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Nosing for sticky sweet with trembling uncurled snout.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But all this beauty was but music played,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>While the high pageant of their hearts prepared.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A spirit thrilled between them, man to maid,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mind flowed in mind, the inner heart was bared,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They needed not to tell how much each cared;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>All the soul's strength was at the other's soul.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Flesh was away awhile, a glory made them whole.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Nothing was said by them; they understood,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They searched each other's eyes without a sound,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Alone with moonlight in the heart of the wood,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Knowing the stars and all the soul of the ground.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Mary," he murmured. "Come." His arms went round,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A white moth glimmered by, the woods were hushed;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The rose at Mary's bosom dropped its petals, crushed.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>No word profaned the peace of that glad giving,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But the warm dimness of the night stood still,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Drawing all beauty to the point of living,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>There in the beech-tree's shadow on the hill.</span>

        <span>Made them one being; Time's decaying thought</span>

        <span>The moonlight found an opening in the boughs;</span>

        <span>It entered in, it filled that sacred place</span>

        <span>With consecration on the throbbing brows;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It came with benediction and with grace.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A whispering came from face to yearning face:</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Beloved, will you wait for me?" "My own."</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"You'll trust and wait for me?" "Yes, yes," she sighed;</span>

        <span>She would wait any term of years, all time--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So faithful to first love these souls abide,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Carrying a man's soul with them as they climb.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Life was all flower to them; the church bells' chime</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Rang out the burning hour ere they had sealed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Love's charter there below the June sky's starry field.</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Sweetly the church bells' music reached the wood,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Chiming an old slow tune of some old hymn,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Calling them back to life from where they stood</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Under the moonlit beech-tree grey and dim.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Mary," he murmured; pressing close to him,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Her kiss came on the gift he gave her there,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A silken scarf that bore her name worked in his hair.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But still the two affixed their hands and seals</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To a life compact witnessed by the sky,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where the great planets drove their glittering wheels,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Bringing conflicting fate, making men die.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">

        <span>"Oh, beauty of my love," "My lovely man."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">

        <span>Time cannot pause, however dear the wooer;</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Left to the lovers, dwindled swiftly fewer,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Blow, one by one, until the bare stalk cowers,</span>
      </div>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Daffodil-picker Time took from their lives the glow,</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Stole their last walk along the three green fields,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Their latest hour together; he took, he stole</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The white contentment that a true love yields;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He took the triumph out of Mary's soul.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Now she must lie awake and blow the coal</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of sorrow of heart. The parting hour came;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They kissed their last good-bye, murmuring the other's name.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then the flag waved, the engine snorted, then</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Slowly the couplings tautened, and the train</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Moved, bearing off from her her man of men;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She looked towards its going blind with pain.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Her father turned and drove her home again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It was a different home. Awhile she tried</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To cook the dinner there, but flung her down and cried.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then in the dusk she wandered down the brook,</span>

        <span>Treading again the trackway trod of old,</span>
      </div>

        <span>When she could hold her loved one in a look.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The night was all unlike those nights of gold.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Michael was gone, and all the April old,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Withered and hidden. Life was full of ills;</span>
      </div>

        <span>On which the tugboat bearing Michael beat,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Past whitened horse bones sticking in the mud.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The reed stems looked like metal in the heat.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then the banks fell away, and there were neat,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Red herds of sullen cattle drifting slow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">

        <span>Wormed hard-wood piles were driv'n in the river bank,</span>

        <span>The steamer threshed alongside with sick screws</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Churning the mud below her till it stank;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Big gassy butcher-bubbles burst on the ooze.</span>
      </div>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>One not a native there, the Gauchos flung</span>
      </div>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The bowfast was cast off, the screw revolved,</span>

        <span>Making a bloodier bubbling; rattling rope</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Fell to the hatch, the engine's tune resolved</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Into its steadier beat of rise and slope;</span>
      </div>

        <span>Died as she lessened; he was there alone.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The lowing of the cattle made a gradual moan.</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He thought of Mary, but the thought was dim;</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>That was another life, lived long before.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His mind was in new worlds which altered him.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The startling present left no room for more.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The sullen river lipped, the sky, the shore</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Were vaster than of old, and lonely, lonely.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Sky and low hills of grass and moaning cattle only.</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But for a hut bestrewn with skulls of beeves,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Round which the flies danced, where an Indian girl</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Bleared at him from her eyes' ophthalmic eaves,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Grinning a welcome; with a throaty skirl,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She offered him herself; but he, the churl,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Stared till she thought him fool; she turned, she sat,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Scratched in her short, black hair, chewed a cigar-end, spat.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Up, on the rise, the cattle bunched; the bulls</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Drew to the front with menace, pawing bold,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Snatching the grass-roots out with sudden pulls,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The distant cattle raised their heads; the wold</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Grew dusty at the top; a waggon rolled,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Drawn by a bickering team of mules whose eyes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Were yellow like their teeth and bared and full of vice.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Down to the jetty came the jingling team,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>An Irish cowboy driving, while a Greek</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Beside him urged the mules with blow and scream.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They cheered the Indian girl and stopped to speak.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then lifting her aloft they kissed her cheek,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Calling to Michael to be quick aboard,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Or they (they said) would fall from virtue, by the Lord.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So Michael climbed aboard, and all day long</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He drove the cattle range, rise after rise,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Dotted with limber shorthorns grazing strong,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Cropping sweet-tasted pasture, switching flies;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Dull trouble brooded in their smoky eyes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Some horsemen watched them. As the sun went down,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The waggon reached the estancia builded like a town.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>With wide corrales where the horses squealed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Biting and lashing out; some half-wild hounds</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Gnawed at the cowbones littered on the field,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Or made the stallions stretch their picket bounds.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Some hides were drying; horsemen came from rounds,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Unsaddled stiff, and turned their mounts to feed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And then brewed bitter drink and sucked it through a reed.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The Irishman removed his pipe and spoke:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"You take a fool's advice," he said. "Return.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Go back where you belong before you're broke;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You'll spoil more clothes at this job than you'll earn;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It's living death, and when you die you'll burn:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Body and soul it takes you. Quit it. No?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Don't say I never told you, then. Amigos. Ho.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Here comes a Gringo; make him pay his shot.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Pay up your footing, Michael; rum's the word,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It suits my genius, and I need a lot."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So the great cauldron full was mixed and stirred.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And all night long the startled cattle heard</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Shouting and shooting, and the moon beheld</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mobs of dim, struggling men, who fired guns and yelled</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That they were Abel Brown just come to town,</span>

        <span>Michael among them. By a bonfire some</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Betted on red and black for money down,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Snatching their clinking winnings, eager, dumb.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Some danced unclad, rubbing their heads with rum.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The grey dawn, bringing beauty to the skies,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Saw Michael stretched among them, far too drunk to rise.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His footing paid, he joined the living-shed,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lined with rude bunks and set with trestles: there</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He, like the other ranchers, slept and fed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Save when the staff encamped in open air,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Rounding the herd for branding. Rude and bare</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That barrack was; men littered it about</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>With saddles, blankets blue, old headstalls, many a clout</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Torn off to wipe a knife or clean a gun,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Tin dishes, sailors' hookpots, all the mess</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Made where the outdoor work is never done</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Men came from work too tired to undress,</span>

        <span>And slept all standing like the trooper's horse;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then with the sun they rose to ride the burning course,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Whacking the shipment cattle into pen,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where, in the dust, among the stink of burning,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The half-mad heifers bolted from the men,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And tossing horns arose and hoofs were churning,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A lover there had little time for yearning;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But all day long, cursing the flies and heat,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Michael was handling steers on horseback till his feet</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Gave on dismounting. All day long he rode,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then, when the darkness came, his mates and he</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Entered dog-tired to the rude abode</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And ate their meat and sucked their bitter tea,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And rolled themselves in rugs and slept. The sea</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Could not make men more drowsy; like the dead,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They lay under the lamp while the mosquitoes fed.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>There was no time to think of Mary, none;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>For when the work relaxed, the time for thought</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Was broken up by men demanding fun:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Cards, or a well-kept ring while someone fought,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Or songs and dancing; or a case was bought</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of white Brazilian rum, and songs and cheers</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And shots and oaths rang loud upon the twitching ears</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of the hobbled horses hopping to their feed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So violent images displaced the rose</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>In Michael's spirit; soon he took the lead;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>None was more apt than he for games or blows.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Even as the battle-seeking bantam crows,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So crowed the cockerel of his mind to feel</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Life's bonds removed and blood quick in him toe to heel.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But sometimes when her letters came to him,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Full of wise tenderness and maiden mind,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He felt that he had let his clearness dim;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The riot with the cowboys seemed unkind</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To that far faithful heart; he could not find</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Peace in the thought of her; he found no spur</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To instant upright action in his love for her.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She faded to the memory of a kiss,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>There in the rough life among foreign faces;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Love cannot live where leisure never is;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He could not write to her from savage places,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where drunken mates were betting on the aces,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And rum went round and smutty songs were lifted.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He would not raise her banner against that; he drifted,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Ceasing, in time, to write, ceasing to think,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But happy in the wild life to the bone;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The riding in vast space, the songs, the drink,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Some careless heart beside him like his own,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The racing and the fights, the ease unknown</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>In older, soberer lands; his young blood thrilled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The pampas seemed his own, his cup of joy was filled.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And one day, riding far after strayed horses,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He rode beyond the ranges to a land</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Broken and made most green by watercourses,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Which served as strayline to the neighbouring brand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A house stood near the brook; he stayed his hand,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Seeing a woman there, whose great eyes burned,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So that he could not choose but follow when she turned.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>After that day he often rode to see</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That woman at the peach farm near the brook,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And passionate love between them came to be</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Ere many days. Their fill of love they took;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And even as the blank leaves of a book</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The days went over Mary, day by day,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Blank as the last, was turned, endured, passed, turned away.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Spring came again greening the hawthorn buds;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The shaking flowers, new-blossomed, seemed the same,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And April put her riot in young bloods;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The jays flapped in the larch clump like blue flame.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She did not care; his letter never came.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Silent she went, nursing the grief that kills,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And Lion watched her pass among the daffodils.</span>

        <span>Time passed, but still no letter came; she ceased,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Almost, to hope, but never to expect.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The June moon came which had beheld love's feast,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then waned, like it; the meadow-grass was flecked</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>With moon-daisies, which died; little she recked</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of change in outward things, she did not change;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Her heart still knew one star, one hope, it did not range,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Like to the watery hearts of tidal men,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Swayed by all moons of beauty; she was firm,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>When most convinced of misery firmest then.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She held a light not subject to the worm.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The pageant of the summer ran its term,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The last stack came to staddle from the wain;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The snow fell, the snow thawed, the year began again.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>With the wet glistening gold of celandines,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>And snowdrops pushing from the withered grass,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Before the bud upon the hawthorn greens,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>"You're going like a ghost," her father said;</span>

        <span>It was an April morning brisk with wind,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>She wandered out along the brook sick-hearted,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Picking the daffodils where the water dinned,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>While overhead the first-come swallow darted.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>There, at the place where all the passion started,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where love first knocked about her maiden heart,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Young Lion Occleve hailed her, calling her apart</span>

    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To see his tulips at The Roughs, and take</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A spray of flowering currant; so she went.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It is a bitter moment, when hearts ache,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To see the loved unhappy; his intent</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Was but to try to comfort her; he meant</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To show her that he knew her heart's despair,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And that his own heart bled to see her wretched there.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So, as they talked, he asked her, had she heard</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>From Michael lately? No, she had not; she</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Had been a great while now, without a word.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"No news is always good news," answered he.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"You know," he said, "how much you mean to me;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You've always been the queen. Oh, if I could</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Do anything to help, my dear, you know I would."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Nothing," she said, much touched. "But you believe--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You still believe in him?" "Why, yes," he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lie though it was he did not dare deceive</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The all too cruel faith within the maid.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"That ranching is a wild and lonely trade,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Far from all posts; it may be hard to send;</span>

        <span>"We should have heard if he were ill or dead.</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Keep a good heart. Now come"; he led the way</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Beyond the barton to the calving-shed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where, on a strawy litter topped with hay,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A double-pedigree prize bull-calf lay.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Near three weeks old," he said, "the Wrekin's pet;</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Come up, now, son, come up; you haven't seen him yet.</span>

    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"We have done well," he added, "with the stock,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>But this one, if he lives, will make a name."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The bull-calf gambolled with his tail acock,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then shyly nosed towards them, scared but tame;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His troublous eyes were sulky with blue flame.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Softly he tip-toed, shying at a touch;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He nosed, his breath came sweet, his pale tongue curled to clutch.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They rubbed his head, and Mary went her way,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Counting the dreary time, the dreary beat</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of dreary minutes dragging through the day;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Time crawled across her life with leaden feet;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>There still remained a year before her sweet</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Would come to claim her; surely he would come;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Meanwhile there was the year, her weakening father, home.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Home with its deadly round, with all its setting,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Things, rooms, and fields and flowers to sting, to burn</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>With memories of the love time past forgetting</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Ere absence made her very being yearn.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"My love, be quick," she moaned, "return, return;</span>

        <span>Then, in the winds of March, her father rode,</span>

        <span>Hounds were whipped off; men muttered with one breath,</span>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Caused her to settle, having stilled her cares,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>In the long cottage under Spital Gree.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">

        <span>Huge-shouldered, scaled above a hundred stone,</span>
      </div>

        <span>Till a meat-breeding rancher on the plains</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Meaning to cross his cows with heavier strains</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Until his yield of meat and bone increased.</span>

        <span>The great beast raised his head and bellowed loud,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Challenging that expanse and that new air;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Trembling, but full of wrath and thunder-browed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Far from the daffodil fields and friends, but proud,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His wild eye kindled at the great expanse.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Two scraps of Shropshire life they stood there; their advance</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Was slow along the well-grassed cattle land,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But at the last an end was made; the brute</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Ate his last bread crust from his master's hand,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And snuffed the foreign herd and stamped his foot;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Steers on the swelling ranges gave salute.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The great bull bellowed back and Lion turned;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His task was now to find where Michael lived; he learned</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The farm's direction, and with heavy mind,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Thinking of Mary and her sorrow, rode,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Leaving the offspring of his fields behind.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A last time in his ears the great bull lowed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then, shaking up his horse, the young man glowed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To see the unfenced pampas opening out</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Grass that makes old earth sing and all the valleys shout.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>At sunset on the second day he came</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To that white cabin in the peach-tree plot</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where Michael lived; they met, the Shropshire name</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Rang trebly dear in that outlandish spot.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Old memories swam up dear, old joys forgot,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Old friends were real again; but Mary's woe</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Came into Lion's mind, and Michael vexed him so,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Talking with careless freshness, side by side</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>With that dark Spanish beauty who had won,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>As though no heart-broke woman, heavy-eyed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mourned for him over sea, as though the sun</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Shone but to light his steps to love and fun,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>While she, that golden and beloved soul,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Worth ten of him, lay wasting like an unlit coal.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So supper passed; the meat in Lion's gorge</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Stuck at the last, he could not bide that face.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The idle laughter on it plied the forge</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where hate was smithying tools; the jokes, the place,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Wrought him to wrath; he could not stay for grace.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The tin mug full of red wine spilled and fell.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He kicked his stool aside with "Michael, this is hell.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Come out into the night and talk to me."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The young man lit a cigarette and followed;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The stars seemed trembling at a brink to see;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A little ghostly white-owl stooped and holloed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Beside the stake-fence Lion stopped and swallowed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>While all the wrath within him made him grey.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Michael stood still and smoked, and flicked his ash away.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Well, Lion," Michael said, "men make mistakes,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>And then regret them; and an early flame</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Is frequently the worst mistake man makes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I did not seek this passion, but it came.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Love happens so in life. Well? Who's to blame?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You'll say I've broken Mary's heart; the heart</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Is not the whole of life, but an inferior part,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Useful for some few years and then a curse.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Nerves should be stronger. You have come to say</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The three-year term is up; so much the worse.</span>
      </div>

        <span>I cannot meet the bill; I cannot pay.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I would not if I could. Men change. To-day</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I know that that first choice, however sweet,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Was wrong and a mistake; it would have meant defeat,</span>

      <div class="left line">

      <div class="left line">
        <span>That the warm link which holds you to her snaps.</span>

        <span>Yet she is bright and I am water. Well,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I did not make myself; this life is often hell.</span>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Eating her heart out for a line, a word,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>News that you were not dead; news that she never heard.</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Not once, after the first. She has held firm</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>To what you counted pastime; she has wept</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Life, day by weary day throughout the term,</span>

        <span>Holiday, feasting; you are fat; you smile.</span>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The cigarette-end glowed and dimmed with ash;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A preying night bird whimpered on the hill.</span>
      </div>

        <span>Michael said "Ah!" and fingered with his sash,</span>

        <span>Then stilled. The night was still; there came no flash</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of sudden passion bursting. All was still;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A lonely water gurgled like a whip-poor-will.</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Now I must go," said Lion; "where's the horse?"</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>"There," said his friend; "I'll set you on your way."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They caught and rode, both silent, while remorse</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Worked in each heart, though neither would betray</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>What he was feeling, and the moon came grey,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then burned into an opal white and great,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Silvering the downs of grass where these two travelled late,</span>

    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Thinking of English fields which that moon saw,</span>

        <span>Fields full of quiet beauty lying hushed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>At midnight in the moment full of awe,</span>

        <span>When the red fox comes creeping, dewy-brushed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But neither spoke; they rode; the horses rushed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Scattering the great clods skywards with such thrills</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">

        <span>The river brimming full was silvered over</span>

        <span>By moonlight at the ford; the river bank</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Smelt of bruised clote buds and of yellow clover.</span>
      </div>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Warmed by the gallop on the unfenced fallows,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Felt it a kindlier thing to make amends.</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Something august was quick in all that sky,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Wheeling in multitudinous march with fire;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The falling of the wind brought it more nigh,</span>

        <span>The horses shifted foothold in the mire,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Splashing and making eddies. Lion spoke:</span>

    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"That Christmas Eve, when all the bells were ringing,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So that we picked out seven churches' bells,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Ringing the night, and people carol-singing?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It hummed and died away and rose in swells</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Like a sea breaking. We have been through hells</span>

        <span>"Yes," Michael answered, "they were happy times,</span>

        <span>Riding beyond there; but a man needs change;</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>I know what they connote, those Christmas chimes,</span>

        <span>Fudge in the heart, and pudding in the grange.</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>It stifles me all that; I need the range,</span>

        <span>Like this before us, open to the sky;</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>There every wing is clipped, but here a man can fly."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Ah," said his friend, "man only flies in youth,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>A few short years at most, until he finds</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That even quiet is a form of truth,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And all the rest a coloured rag that blinds.</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Life offers nothing but contented minds.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Some day you'll know it, Michael. I am grieved</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>That Mary's heart will pay until I am believed."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>There was a silence while the water dripped</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>From the raised muzzles champing on the steel.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Flogging the crannied banks the water lipped.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Night up above them turned her starry wheel;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And each man feared to let the other feel</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>How much he felt; they fenced; they put up bars.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The moon made heaven pale among the withering stars.</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Michael," said Lion, "why should we two part?</span>

        <span>Ride on with me; or shall we both return,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Make preparation, and to-morrow start,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And travel home together? You would learn</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>How much the people long to see you; turn.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>We will ride back and say good-bye, and then</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Sail, and see home again, and see the Shropshire men,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"And see the old Shropshire mountain and the fair,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Full of drunk Welshmen bringing mountain ewes;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And partridge shooting would be starting there."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Michael hung down his head and seemed to choose.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The horses churned fresh footing in the ooze.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then Michael asked if Tom were still alive,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Old Tom, who fought the Welshman under Upton Drive,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>For nineteen rounds, on grass, with the bare hands?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Shaky," said Lion, "living still, but weak;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Almost past speaking, but he understands."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"And old Shon Shones we teased so with the leek?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Dead." "When?" "December." Michael did not speak,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But muttered "Old Jones dead." A minute passed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"What came to little Sue, his girl?" he said at last.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Got into trouble with a man and died;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Her sister keeps the child." His hearer stirred.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Dead, too? She was a pretty girl," he sighed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"A graceful pretty creature, like a bird.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>What is the child?" "A boy. Her sister heard</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Too late to help; poor Susan died; the man</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>None knew who he could be, but many rumours ran."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Ah," Michael said. The horses tossed their heads;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A little wind arising struck in chill;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Time," he began, "that we were in our beds."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A distant heifer challenged from the hill,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Scraped at the earth with 's forefoot and was still.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Come with me," Lion pleaded. Michael grinned;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He turned his splashing horse, and prophesied a wind.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"So long," he said, and "Kind of you to call.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Straight on, and watch the stars"; his horse's feet</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Trampled the firmer foothold, ending all.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He flung behind no message to his sweet,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>No other word to Lion; the dull beat</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of his horse's trample drummed upon the trail;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lion could watch him drooping in the moonlight pale,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Drooping and lessening; half expectant still</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That he would turn and greet him; but no sound</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Came, save the lonely water's whip-poor-will</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And the going horse hoofs dying on the ground.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Michael," he cried, "Michael!" A lonely mound</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Beyond the water gave him back the cry.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"That's at an end," he said, "and I have failed her--I."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Soon the far hoof-beats died, save for a stir</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Half heard, then lost, then still, then heard again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A quickening rhythm showed he plied the spur.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then a vast breathing silence took the plain.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The moon was like a soul within the brain</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of the great sleeping world; silent she rode</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The water talked, talked, talked; it trembled as it flowed.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A moment Lion thought to ride in chase.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He turned, then turned again, knowing his friend.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He forded through with death upon his face,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And rode the plain that seemed never to end.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Clumps of pale cattle nosed the thing unkenned,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Riding the night; out of the night they rose,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Snuffing with outstretched heads, stamping with surly lows,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Till he was threading through a crowd, a sea</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of curious shorthorns backing as he came,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Barring his path, but shifting warily;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He slapped the hairy flanks of the more tame.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Unreal the ghostly cattle lumbered lame.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His horse kept at an even pace; the cows</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Broke right and left like waves before advancing bows.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lonely the pampas seemed amid that herd.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The thought of Mary's sorrow pricked him sore;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He brought no comfort for her, not a word;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He would not ease her pain, but bring her more.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The long miles dropped behind; lights rose before,</span>

        <span>Lights and the seaport and the briny air;</span>
      </div>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And more than this: for Lion touched a sense</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That he, the honest humdrum man, was more</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Than he by whom the glory and the offence</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Came to her life three bitter years before.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>This was a treason in her being's core;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It smouldered there; meanwhile as two good friends</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They met at autumn dusks and winter daylight-ends.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And once, after long twilight talk, he broke</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His strong restraint upon his passion for her,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And burningly, most like a man he spoke,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Until her pity almost overbore her.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It could not be, she said; her pity tore her;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But still it could not be, though this was pain.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then on a frosty night they met and spoke again.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And then he wooed again, clutching her hands,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Calling the maid his mind, his heart, his soul,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Saying that God had linked their lives in bands</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>When the worm Life first started from the goal;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That they were linked together, past control,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Linked from all time, could she but pity; she</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Pitied him from the soul, but said it could not be.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Mary," he asked, "you cannot love me? No?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"No," she replied; "would God I could, my dear."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"God bless you, then," he answered, "I must go,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Go over sea to get away from here,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I cannot think of work when you are near;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>My whole life falls to pieces; it must end.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>This meeting now must be 'good-bye,' beloved friend."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>White-lipped she listened, then with failing breath,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She asked for yet a little time; her face</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Was even as that of one condemned to death.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She asked for yet another three months' grace,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Asked it, as Lion inly knew, in case</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Michael should still return; and "Yes" said he,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"I'll wait three months for you, beloved; let it be."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Slowly the three months dragged: no Michael came.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>March brought the daffodils and set them shaking.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>April was quick in Nature like green flame;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>May came with dog-rose buds, and corncrakes craking,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then dwindled like her blossom; June was breaking.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Mary," said Lion, "can you answer now?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>White like a ghost she stood, he long remembered how.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Wild-eyed and white, and trembling like a leaf,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She gave her answer, "Yes"; she gave her lips,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Cold as a corpse's to the kiss of grief,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Shuddering at him as if his touch were whips.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then her best nature, struggling to eclipse</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>This shrinking self, made speech; she jested there;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They searched each other's eyes, and both souls saw despair.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So the first passed, and after that began</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A happier time: she could not choose but praise</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That recognition of her in the man</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Striving to salve her pride in myriad ways;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He was a gentle lover: gentle days</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Passed like a music after tragic scenes;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Her heart gave thanks for that; but still the might-have-beens</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Haunted her inner spirit day and night,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And often in his kiss the memory came</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of Michael's face above her, passionate, white,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His lips at her lips murmuring her name,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then she would suffer sleepless, sick with shame,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And struggle with her weakness. She had vowed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To give herself to Lion; she was true and proud.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He should not have a woman sick with ghosts,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But one firm-minded to be his; so time</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Passed one by one the summer's marking posts,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The dog-rose and the foxglove and the lime.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then on a day the church-bells rang a chime.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Men fired the bells till all the valley filled</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>With bell-noise from the belfry where the jackdaws build.</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lion and she were married; home they went,</span>

        <span>Home to The Roughs as man and wife; the news</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Was printed in the paper. Mary sent</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Tossed out the pack to Michael, whistling low,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then rode, waving his hand, without more comment,</span>
      </div>

        <span>Thrilled him with vague alarm, it brought him to a stand.</span>
      </div>

        <span>He opened it with one eye on the hut,</span>

        <span>Lest she within were watching him, but she</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Was combing out her hair, the door was shut,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The green sun-shutters closed, she could not see.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Out fell the love-tryst handkerchief which he</span>
      </div>

        <span>Had had embroidered with his name for her;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It had been dearly kept, it smelt of lavender.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Something remained: a paper, crossed with blue,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where he should read; he stood there in the sun,</span>
      </div>

        <span>Reading of Mary's wedding till he knew</span>

        <span>He pocketed the love gift and took horse,</span>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then turned, and rode a lonely water-course,</span>

        <span>Alone with bitter thoughts and bitter cravings.</span>
      </div>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>A passion for those old kind Shropshire places,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>The orange-bellied turtle burrowed further down.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He could remember Mary now; her crying</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Night after night alone through weary years,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Had touched him now and set the cords replying;</span>

        <span>Loss of the lover's faith, the letting comfort go.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Now I will ride," he said. Beyond the ford</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He caught a fresh horse and rode on. The night</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Found him a guest at Pepe Blanco's board,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Moody and drinking rum and ripe for fight;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Drawing his gun, he shot away the light,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>And parried Pepe's knife and caught his horse,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And all night long he rode bedevilled by remorse.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>At dawn he caught an eastward-going ferry,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And all day long he steamed between great banks</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Which smelt of yellow thorn and loganberry.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then wharves appeared, and chimneys rose in ranks,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mast upon mast arose; the river's flanks</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Were filled with English ships, and one he found</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Needing another stoker, being homeward bound.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And all the time the trouble in his head</span>

        <span>Ran like a whirlwind moving him; he knew</span>
      </div>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She sailed that night: he dulled his maddened soul,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Plying the iron coal-slice on the bunker coal.</span>

        <span>Fragrance that gave his memory's guard a hint</span>

        <span>Of times long past, of reapers in the corn,</span>

      <div class="left line">

        <span>Old Mrs. Occleve talked to one inside.</span>

        <span>Pourri was being made; the listener heard</span>

        <span>Things lifted and laid down, bruised into sweetness, stirred.</span>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That Roger's wife at Upton had a son,</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Steps clacked on flagstones to the outer door;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A dairy-maid, whom he remembered well,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lined, now, with age, and grayer than before,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Rang a cracked cow-bell for the dinner-bell.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He saw the dining-room; he could not tell</span>

        <span>If Mary were within: inly he knew</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That she was coming now, that she would be in blue,</span>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Blue with a silver locket at the throat,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And that she would be there, within there, near,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>With the little blushes that he knew by rote,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And the grey eyes so steadfast and so dear,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The voice, pure like the nature, true and clear,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Speaking to her belov'd within the room.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The gate clicked, Lion came: the outcast hugged the gloom,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Watching intently from below the boughs,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>While Lion cleared his riding-boots of clay,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Eyed the high clouds and went within the house.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His eyes looked troubled, and his hair looked gray.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Dinner began within with much to say.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Old Occleve roared aloud at his own joke.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mary, it seemed, was gone; the loved voice never spoke.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Nor could her lover see her from the yew;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She was not there at table; she was ill,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Ill, or away perhaps--he wished he knew.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Away, perhaps, for Occleve bellowed still.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"If sick," he thought, "the maid or Lion will</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Take food to her." He watched; the dinner ended.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The staircase was not used; none climbed it, none descended.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Not here," he thought; but wishing to be sure,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He waited till the Occleves went to field,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then followed, round the house, another lure,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Using the well-known privet as his shield.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He meant to run a risk; his heart was steeled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He knew of old which bedroom would be hers;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He crouched upon the north front in among the firs.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The house stared at him with its red-brick blank,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Its vacant window-eyes; its open door,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>With old wrought bridle ring-hooks at each flank,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Swayed on a creaking hinge as the wind bore.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Nothing had changed; the house was as before,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The dull red brick, the windows sealed or wide:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"I will go in," he said. He rose and stepped inside.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>None could have seen him coming; all was still;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He listened in the doorway for a sign.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Above, a rafter creaked, a stir, a thrill</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Moved, till the frames clacked on the picture line.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Old Mother Occleve sleeps, the servants dine,"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He muttered, listening. "Hush." A silence brooded.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Far off the kitchen dinner clattered; he intruded.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Still, to his right, the best room door was locked.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Another door was at his left; he stayed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Within, a stately timepiece ticked and tocked,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To one who slumbered breathing deep; it made</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>An image of Time's going and man's trade.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He looked: Old Mother Occleve lay asleep,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Hands crossed upon her knitting, rosy, breathing deep.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He tiptoed up the stairs which creaked and cracked.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The landing creaked; the shut doors, painted gray,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Loomed, as if shutting in some dreadful act.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The nodding frames seemed ready to betray.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The east room had been closed in Michael's day,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Being the best; but now he guessed it hers;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The fields of daffodils lay next it, past the firs.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Just as he reached the landing, Lion cried,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Somewhere below, "I'll get it." Lion's feet</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Struck on the flagstones with a hasty stride.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"He's coming up," thought Michael, "we shall meet."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He snatched the nearest door for his retreat,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Opened with thieves' swift silence, dared not close,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But stood within, behind it. Lion's footsteps rose,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Running two steps at once, while Michael stood,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Not breathing, only knowing that the room</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Was someone's bedroom smelling of old wood,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Hung with engravings of the day of doom.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The footsteps stopped; and Lion called, to whom?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A gentle question, tapping at a door,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And Michael shifted feet, and creakings took the floor.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The footsteps recommenced, a door-catch clacked;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Within an eastern room the footsteps passed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Drawers were pulled loudly open and ransacked,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Chattels were thrust aside and overcast.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>What could the thing be that he sought. At last</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His voice said, "Here it is." The wormed floor</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Creaked with returning footsteps down the corridor.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The footsteps came as though the walker read,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Or added rows of figures by the way;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>There was much hesitation in the tread;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lion seemed pondering which, to go or stay;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then, seeing the door, which covered Michael, sway,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He swiftly crossed and shut it. "Always one</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>For order," Michael muttered. "Now be swift, my son."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The action seemed to break the walker's mood;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The footsteps passed downstairs, along the hall,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Out at the door and off towards the wood.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Gone," Michael muttered. "Now to hazard all."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Outside, the frames still nodded on the wall.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Michael stepped swiftly up the floor to try</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The door where Lion tapped and waited for reply.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It was the eastmost of the rooms which look</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Over the fields of daffodils; the bound</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Scanned from its windows is Ryemeadows brook,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Banked by gnarled apple trees and rising ground.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Most gently Michael tapped; he heard no sound,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Only the blind-pull tapping with the wind;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The kitchen-door was opened; kitchen-clatter dinned.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A woman walked along the hall below,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Humming; a maid, he judged; the footsteps died,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Listening intently still, he heard them go,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then swiftly turned the knob and went inside.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The blind-pull at the window volleyed wide;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The curtains streamed out like a waterfall;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The pictures of the fox-hunt clacked along the wall.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>No one was there; no one; the room was hers.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A book of praise lay open on the bed;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The clothes-press smelt of many lavenders,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Her spirit stamped the room; herself was fled.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Here she found peace of soul like daily bread,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Here, with her lover Lion; Michael gazed;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He would have been the sharer had he not been crazed.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He took the love-gift handkerchief again;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He laid it on her table, near the glass,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So opened that the broidered name was plain;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Plain," he exclaimed, "she cannot let it pass.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It stands and speaks for me as bold as brass.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>My answer, my heart's cry, to tell her this,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That she is still my darling: all she was she is.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"So she will know at least that she was wrong,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That underneath the blindness I was true.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Fate is the strongest thing, though men are strong;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Out from beyond life I was sealed to you.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But my blind ways destroyed the cords that drew;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And now, the evil done, I know my need;</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Fate has his way with those who mar what is decreed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"And now, goodbye." He closed the door behind him,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then stept, with firm swift footstep down the stair,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Meaning to go where she would never find him;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He would go down through darkness to despair.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Out at the door he stept; the autumn air</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Came fresh upon his face; none saw him go.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Goodbye, my love," he muttered; "it is better so."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Soon he was on the high road, out of sight</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of valley and farm; soon he could see no more</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The oast-house pointing finger take the light</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>As tumbling pigeons glittered over; nor</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Could he behold the wind-vane gilded o'er,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Swinging above the church; the road swung round.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Now, the last look," he cried: he saw that holy ground.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Goodbye," he cried; he could behold it all,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Spread out as in a picture; but so clear</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That the gold apple stood out from the wall;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Like a red jewel stood the grazing steer.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Precise, intensely coloured, all brought near,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>As in a vision, lay that holy ground.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Mary is there," he moaned, "and I am outward bound.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"I never saw this place so beautiful,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Never like this. I never saw it glow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Spirit is on this place; it fills it full.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So let the die be cast; I will not go.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But I will see her face to face and know</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>From her own lips what thoughts she has of me;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And if disaster come: right; let disaster be."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Back, by another way, he turned. The sun</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Fired the yew-tops in the Roman woods.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lights in the valley twinkled one by one,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The starlings whirled in dropping multitudes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Dusk fingered into one earth's many moods,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Back to The Roughs he walked; he neared the brook;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A lamp burned in the farm; he saw; his fingers shook.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He had to cross the brook, to cross a field,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where daffodils were thick when years were young.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then, were she there, his fortunes should be sealed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Down the mud trackway to the brook he swung;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then while the passion trembled on his tongue,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Dim, by the dim bridge-stile, he seemed to see</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A figure standing mute; a woman--it was she.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She stood quite stilly, waiting for him there.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She did not seem surprised; the meeting seemed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Planned from all time by powers in the air</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To change their human fates; he even deemed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That in another life this thing had gleamed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>This meeting by the bridge. He said, "It's you."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Yes, I," she said, "who else? You must have known; you knew</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"That I should come here to the brook to see,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>After your message." "You were out," he said.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Gone, and I did not know where you could be.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where were you, Mary, when the thing was laid?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Old Mrs. Gale is dying, and I stayed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Longer than usual, while I read the Word.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You could have hardly gone." She paused, her bosom stirred.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Mary, I sinned," he said. "Not that, dear, no,"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She said; "but, oh, you were unkind, unkind,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Never to write a word and leave me so,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But out of sight with you is out of mind."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Mary, I sinned," he said, "and I was blind.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Oh, my beloved, are you Lion's wife?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Belov'd sounds strange," she answered, "in my present life.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"But it is sweet to hear it, all the same.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It is a language little heard by me</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Alone, in that man's keeping, with my shame.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I never thought such miseries could be.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I was so happy in you, Michael. He</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Came when I felt you changed from what I thought you.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Even now it is not love, but jealousy that brought you."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"That is untrue," he said. "I am in hell.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You are my heart's beloved, Mary, you.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>By God, I know your beauty now too well.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>We are each other's, flesh and soul, we two."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"That was sweet knowledge once," she said; "we knew</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That truth of old. Now, in a strange man's bed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I read it in my soul, and find it written red."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Is he a brute?" he asked. "No," she replied.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"I did not understand what it would mean.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And now that you are back, would I had died;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Died, and the misery of it not have been.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lion would not be wrecked, nor I unclean.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I was a proud one once, and now I'm tame;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Oh, Michael, say some word to take away my shame."</span>

        <span>White, large and noble, steady as a rock,</span>

        <span>The flashiness that comes from marshy grounds</span>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">

        <span>What you intend to do, and whither you will go."</span>

    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Go from this place; it chokes me," she replied.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"This place has branded me; I must regain</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>My truth that I have soiled, my faith, my pride,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It is all poison and it leaves a stain.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I cannot stay nor be your wife again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Never. You did your best, though; you were kind.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I have grown old to-night and left all that behind.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Goodbye." She turned. Old Occleve faced his son.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Wrath at the woman's impudence was blent,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Upon his face, with wrath that such an one</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Should stand unthrashed until her words were spent.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He stayed for Lion's wrath; but Mary went</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Unchecked; he did not stir. Her footsteps ground</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The gravel to the gate; the gate-hinge made a sound</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Like to a cry of pain after a shot.</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Swinging, it clicked, it clicked again, it swung</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Until the iron latch bar hit the slot.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mary had gone, and Lion held his tongue.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Old Mother Occleve sobbed; her white head hung</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Over her sewing while the tears ran down</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Her worn, blood-threaded cheeks and splashed upon her gown.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Yes, it is true," said Lion, "she must go.</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Michael is back. Michael was always first,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I did but take his place. You did not know.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Now it has happened, and you know the worst.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So passion makes the passionate soul accurst</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And crucifies his darling. Michael comes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And the savage truth appears and rips my life to thrums."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Upon Old Occleve's face the fury changed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>First to contempt, and then to terror lest</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lion, beneath the shock, should be deranged.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Father, good-night," he said, "I'm going to rest.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Good-night, I cannot talk. Mother, good-night."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He kissed her brow and went; they heard him strike a light,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And go with slow depressed step up the stairs,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Up to the door of her deserted bower;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They heard him up above them, moving chairs;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The memory of his paleness made them cower.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They did not know their son; they had no power</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To help, they only saw the new-won bride</span>

        <span>After a time men learned where Mary was:</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Renting a cottage and a patch of grass</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where Michael came to see her. Every day</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Taught her what fevers can inhabit clay,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Shaking this body that so soon must die.</span>
      </div>

        <span>Till the long misery had to end or kill:</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Drawing the women's eyes; he wandered with a child.</span>
      </div>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Who heard, wide-eyed, the scraps of tales which fell</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Between the fragments of the tune; they seemed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A cherub bringing up a soul from hell.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Meeting unlike the meeting long since dreamed.</span>

        <span>Lion dismounted; the great valley gleamed</span>

        <span>With waters far below; his teeth were set</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His heart thumped at his throat; he stopped; the two men met.</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>The child well knew that fatal issues joined;</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>He stood round-eyed to watch them, even as Fate</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Stood with his pennypiece of causes coined</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Ready to throw for issue; the bright hate</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Throbbed, that the heavy reckoning need not wait.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lion stepped forward, watching Michael's eyes.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"We are old friends," he said. "Now, Michael, you be wise,</span>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Ruin for both, whatever promise shone</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>In sentimental shrinkings from the fact.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So, Michael, play the man, and do the generous act.</span>
      </div>

    <div class="line-block outermost">

      <div class="left line">
        <span>You only want her with your sentiment.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You are water roughed by every wind that stirs,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">

        <span>All ways, to every wind, and nothing meant,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Is your life's habit. Man, one takes a wife,</span>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Sentiment sighing will not help you there.</span>
      </div>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I know your love for her. I saw it mired,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mired, past going, by your first sharp taste</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of life and work; it stopped; you let her whole life waste,</span>

    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Rather than have the trouble of such love,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>You will again; but if you do it now,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It will mean death, not sorrow. But enough.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You know too well you cannot keep a vow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>There are gray hairs already on her brow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You brought them there. Death is the next step. Go,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Before you take the step." "No," Michael answered, "No.</span>

    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"As for my past, I was a dog, a cur,</span>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">

        <span>Bodies are earth. I heard you say it. Liar!</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">

        <span>"Michael," said Lion, "you have said such things</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of other women; less than six miles hence</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You and another woman felt love's wings</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Rosy and fair, and so took leave of sense.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She's dead, that other woman, dead, with pence</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Pressed on her big brown eyes, under the ground;</span>
      </div>

        <span>Out there, behind us, living as they can;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Pinched by the poverty that you allow.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>All a long autumn many rumours ran</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>About Sue Jones that was: you were the man.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The lad is like you. Think about his mother,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Before you turn the earth to fire with another."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"That is enough," said Michael, "you shall know</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Soon, to your marrow, what my answer is;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Know to your lying heart; now kindly go.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The neighbours smell that something is amiss.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>We two will keep a dignity in this,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Such as we can. No quarrelling with me here.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mary might see; now go; but recollect, my dear,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"That if you twit me with your wife, you lie;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And that your further insult waits a day</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>When God permits that Mary is not by;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I keep the record of it, and shall pay.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And as for Mary; listen: we betray</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>No one. We keep our troth-plight as we meant.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Now go, the neighbours gather." Lion bowed and went.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Home to his memories for a month of pain,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Each moment like a devil with a tongue,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Urging him, "Set her free," or "Try again,"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Or "Kill that man and stamp him into dung."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"See her," he cried. He took his horse and swung</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Out on the road to her; the rain was falling;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Her dropping house-eaves splashed him when he knocked there, calling.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Drowned yellow jasmine dripped; his horse's flanks</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Steamed, and dark runnels on his yellow hair</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Streaked the groomed surface into blotchy ranks.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The noise of water dropping filled the air.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He knocked again; but there was no one there;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>No one within, the door was locked, no smoke</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Came from the chimney stacks, no clock ticked, no one spoke.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Only the water dripped and dribble-dripped,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And gurgled through the rain-pipe to the butt;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Drops, trickling down the windows paused or slipped;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A wet twig scraked as though the glass were cut.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The blinds were all drawn down, the windows shut.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>No one was there. Across the road a shawl</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Showed at a door a space; a woman gave a call.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"They're gone away," she cried. "They're gone away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Been gone a matter of a week." Where to?</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The woman thought to Wales, but could not say,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Nor if she planned returning; no one knew.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She looked at Lion sharply; then she drew</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The half-door to its place and passed within,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Saying she hoped the rain would stop and spring begin.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lion rode home. A month went by, and now</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Winter was gone; the myriad shoots of green</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Bent to the wind, like hair, upon the plough,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And up from withered leaves came celandine.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And sunlight came, though still the air was keen,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So that the first March market was most fair,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And Lion rode to market, having business there.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And in the afternoon, when all was done,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>While Lion waited idly near the inn,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Watching the pigeons sidling in the sun,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>As Jim the ostler put his gelding in,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He heard a noise of rioting begin</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Outside the yard, with catcalls; there were shouts</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Of "Occleve. Lion Occleve," from a pack of louts,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Who hung about the courtyard-arch, and cried,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Yah, Occleve, of The Roughs, the married man,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Occleve, who had the bed and not the bride."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>At first without the arch; but some began</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To sidle in, still calling; children ran</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To watch the baiting; they were farmer's leavings</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Who shouted thus, men cast for drunkenness and thievings.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lion knew most of them of old; he paid</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>No heed to them, but turned his back and talked</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To Jim, of through-pin in his master's jade,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And how no horse-wounds should be stuped or caulked.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The rabble in the archway, not yet baulked,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Came crowding nearer, and the boys began,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Who was it took your mistress, master married man?"</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Who was it, master, took your wife away?"</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"I wouldn't let another man take mine."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"She had two husbands on her wedding day."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"See at a blush: he blushed as red as wine."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"She'd ought a had a cart-whip laid on fine."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The farmers in the courtyard watched the baiting,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Grinning, the barmaids grinned above the window grating.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then through the mob of brawlers Michael stepped</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Straight to where Lion stood. "I come," he said,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"To give you back some words which I have kept</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Safe in my heart till I could see them paid.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You lied about Sue Jones; she died a maid</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>As far as I'm concerned, and there's your lie,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Full in your throat, and there, and there, and in your eye.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"And there's for stealing Mary" ... as he struck,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He slipped upon a piece of peel and dropped</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Souse in a puddle of the courtyard muck;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Loud laughter followed when he rose up sopped.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Friends rushed to intervene, the fight was stopped.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The two were hurried out by different ways.</span>
      </div>

        <span>White, in a garden green with springing grass,</span>

        <span>Bowed for a time above her wedding ring,</span>
      </div>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">

        <span>Gray on the budding woods the morning hasted,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Over the shaking acre pale with daffodil.</span>

        <span>Piped down the withered husk that was the moon,</span>

      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Cows plodded past, yokes clanked, the men were bringing</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Milk from the barton. Someone shouted "Hup,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Down which the wind flowed much as water flows;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The daffodils bowed down to let it pass.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>At the brook's edge a boggy bit there was,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Right at the field's north corner, near the bridge,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Fenced by a ridge of earth; he sat upon the ridge,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Watching the water running to the sea,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Watching the bridge, the stile, the path beyond,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Where the white violet's sweetness brought the bee.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He paid the price of being overfond.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The water babbled always from the pond</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Over the pretty shallows, chattering, tinkling,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>With trembles from the sunlight in its clearness wrinkling.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So gazing, like one stunned, it reached his mind,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That the hedge-brambles overhung the brook</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>More than was right, making the selvage blind;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The dragging brambles too much flotsam took.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Dully he thought to mend. He fetched a hook,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And standing in the shallow stream he slashed,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>For hours, it seemed; the thorns, the twigs, the dead leaves splashed,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Splashed and were bobbed away across the shallows;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Pale grasses with the sap gone from them fell,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Sank, or were carried down beyond the sallows.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The bruised ground-ivy gave out earthy smell.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"I must be dead," he thought, "and this is hell."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Fiercely he slashed, till, glancing at the stile,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He saw that Michael stood there, watching, with a smile,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His old contemptuous smile of careless ease,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>As though the world with all its myriad pain</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Sufficed, but only just sufficed, to please.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Michael was there, the robber come again.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>A tumult ran like flame in Lion's brain;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then, looking down, he saw the flowers shake:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Gold, trembling daffodils; he turned, he plucked a stake</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Out of the hedge that he had come to mend,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And flung his hook to Michael, crying, "Take;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>We two will settle our accounts, my friend,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Once and for ever. May the Lord God make</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You see your sins in time." He whirled his stake</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And struck at Michael's head; again he struck;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>While Michael dodged and laughed, "Why, man, I bring you luck.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Don't kill a bringer of good news. You fool,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Stop it and listen. I have come to say:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lion, for God's sake, listen and be cool.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You silly hothead, put that stake away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Listen, I tell you." But he could not stay</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The anger flaming in that passionate soul.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Blows rained upon him thick; they stung; he lost control.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Till, "If you want to fight," he cried, "let be.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Let me get off the bridge and we will fight.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That firm bit by the quag will do for me.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So. Be on guard, and God defend the right.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You foaming madman, with your hell's delight,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Smashing a man with stakes before he speaks:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>On guard. I'll make you humbler for the next few weeks."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The ground was level there; the daffodils</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Glimmered and danced beneath their cautious feet,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Quartering for openings for the blow that kills.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Beyond the bubbling brook a thrush was sweet.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Quickly the footsteps slid; with feint and cheat,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The weapons poised and darted and withdrew.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Now stop it," Michael said, "I want to talk to you."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"We do not stop till one of us is dead,",</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Said Lion, rushing in. A short blow fell</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Dizzily, through all guard, on Michael's head.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His hedging-hook slashed blindly but too well:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It struck in Lion's side. Then, for a spell,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Both, sorely stricken, staggered, while their eyes</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Dimmed under mists of blood; they fell, they tried to rise,--</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Tried hard to rise, but could not, so they lay,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Watching the clouds go sailing on the sky,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Touched with a redness from the end of day.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>There was all April in the blackbird's cry.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And lying there they felt they had to die,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Die and go under mould and feel no more</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>April's green fire of life go running in earth's core.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"There was no need to hit me," Michael said;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"You quiet thinking fellows lose control.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>This fighting business is a foolish trade.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And now we join the grave-worm and the mole.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I tried to stop you. You're a crazy soul;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You always were hot-headed. Well, let be:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You deep and passionate souls have always puzzled me.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"I'm sorry that I struck you. I was hit,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And lashed out blindly at you; you were mad.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It would be different if you'd stopped a bit.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You are too blind when you are angry, lad.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Oh, I am giddy, Lion; dying, bad,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Dying." He raised himself, he sat, his look</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Grew greedy for the water bubbling in the brook.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And as he watched it, Lion raised his head;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Out of a bloodied clump of daffodil.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Michael," he moaned, "I, too, am dying: dead.</span>

        <span>You're nearer to the water. Could you fill</span>

        <span>Your hat and give me drink? Or would it spill?</span>

        <span>Spill, I expect." "I'll try," said Michael, "try--</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I may as well die trying, since I have to die."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Slowly he forced his body's failing life</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Down to the water; there he stooped and filled;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And as his back turned Lion drew his knife,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And hid it close, while all his being thrilled</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To see, as Michael came, the water spilled,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Nearer and ever nearer, bright, so bright.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Drink," muttered Michael, "drink. We two shall sleep to-night."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He tilted up the hat, and Lion drank.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lion lay still a moment, gathering power,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then rose, as Michael gave him more, and sank.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then, like a dying bird whom death makes tower,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He raised himself above the bloodied flower</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And struck with all his force in Michael's side.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"You should not have done that," his stricken comrade cried.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"No; for I meant to tell you, Lion; meant</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To tell you; but I cannot now; I die.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That hit me to the heart and I am spent.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mary and I have parted; she and I</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Agreed she must return, lad. That is why</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I came to see you. She is coming here,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Back to your home to-night. Oh, my beloved dear,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"You come to tread a bloody path of flowers.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>All the gold flowers are covered up with blood,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And the bright bugles blow along the towers;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The bugles triumph like the Plate in flood."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His spilled life trickled down upon the mud</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Between weak, clutching fingers. "Oh," he cried,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"This isn't what we planned here years ago." He died.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Lion lay still while the cold tides of death</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Came brimming up his channels. With one hand</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>He groped to know if Michael still drew breath.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>His little hour was running out its sand.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then, in a mist, he saw his Mary stand</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Above. He cried aloud, "He was my brother.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I was his comrade sworn, and we have killed each other.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Oh desolate grief, beloved, and through me.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>We wise who try to change. Oh, you wild birds,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Help my unhappy spirit to the sea.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The golden bowl is scattered into sherds."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And Mary knelt and murmured passionate words</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To that poor body on the dabbled flowers:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Oh, beauty, oh, sweet soul, oh, little love of ours--</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Michael, my own heart's darling, speak; it's me,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Mary. You know my voice. I'm here, dear, here.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Oh, little golden-haired one, listen. See,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It's Mary, Michael. Speak to Mary, dear.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Oh, Michael, little love, he cannot hear;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And you have killed him, Lion; he is dead.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>My little friend, my love, my Michael, golden head.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"We had such fun together, such sweet fun,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>My love and I, my merry love and I.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Oh, love, you shone upon me like the sun.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Oh, Michael, say some little last good-bye."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then in a great voice Lion called, "I die.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Go home and tell my people. Mary. Hear.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Though I have wrought this ruin, I have loved you, dear.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Better than he; not better, dear, as well.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>If you could kiss me, dearest, at this last.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>We have made bloody doorways from our hell,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Cutting our tangle. Now, the murder past,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>We are but pitiful poor souls; and fast</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The darkness and the cold come. Kiss me, sweet;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>I loved you all my life; but some lives never meet</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Though they go wandering side by side through Time.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Kiss me," he cried. She bent, she kissed his brow:</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Oh, friend," she said, "you're lying in the slime."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Three blind ones, dear," he murmured, "in the slough,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Caught fast for death; but never mind that now;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Go home and tell my people. I am dying,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Dying, dear, dying now." He died; she left him lying,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And kissed her dead one's head and crossed the field.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"They have been killed," she called, in a great crying.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Killed, and our spirits' eyes are all unsealed.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The blood is scattered on the flowers drying."</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>It was the hush of dusk, and owls were flying;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They hooted as the Occleves ran to bring</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>That sorry harvest home from Death's red harvesting.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They laid the bodies on the bed together.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And "You were beautiful," she said, "and you</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Were my own darling in the April weather.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>You knew my very soul, you knew, you knew.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Oh, my sweet, piteous love, I was not true.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Fetch me fair water and the flowers of spring;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>My love is dead, and I must deck his burying."</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They left her with her dead; they could not choose</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But grant the spirit burning in her face</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Rights that their pity urged them to refuse.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They did her sorrow and the dead a grace.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>All night they heard her passing footsteps trace</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Down to the garden from the room of death.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>They heard her singing there, lowly, with gentle breath,</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>To the cool darkness full of sleeping flowers,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Then back, still singing soft, with quiet tread,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>But at the dawn her singing gathered powers</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Like to the dying swan who lifts his head</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>On Eastnor, lifts it, singing, dabbled red,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Singing the glory in his tumbling mind,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Before the doors burst in, before death strikes him blind.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>So triumphing her song of love began,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Ringing across the meadows like old woe</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Sweetened by poets to the help of man</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Unconquered in eternal overthrow;</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Like a great trumpet from the long ago</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Her singing towered; all the valley heard.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Men jingling down to meadow stopped their teams and stirred.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And they, the Occleves, hurried to the door,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>And burst it, fearing; there the singer lay</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Drooped at her lover's bedside on the floor,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Singing her passionate last of life away.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>White flowers had fallen from a blackthorn spray</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Over her loosened hair. Pale flowers of spring</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Filled the white room of death; they covered everything.</span>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Primroses, daffodils, and cuckoo-flowers.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>She bowed her singing head on Michael's breast.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Oh, it was sweet," she cried, "that love of ours.</span>

        <span>You were the dearest, sweet; I loved you best.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Beloved, my beloved, let me rest</span>

        <span>By you forever, little Michael mine.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Now the great hour is stricken, and the bread and wine</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>"Broken and spilt; and now the homing birds</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Bury us two together," came her words.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The dropping petals fell about the two.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Her heart had broken; she was dead. They drew</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Her gentle head aside; they found it pressed</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>Against the broidered 'kerchief spread on Michael's breast,</span>
      </div>

    <div class="line-block outermost">
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The one that bore her name in Michael's hair,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>Given so long before. They let her lie,</span>

      <div class="left line">
        <span>While the dim moon died out upon the air,</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>And happy sunlight coloured all the sky.</span>
      </div>
      <div class="left line">
        <span>The last cock crowed for morning; carts went by;</span>

        <span>Smoke rose from cottage chimneys; from the byre</span>

        <span>In the day's noise the water's noise was stilled,</span>

        <span>Dropping from leafy hollows, which it filled,</span>

        <span>Slowly it loitered past the shivering reeds</span>

        <span>Into a mightier water; thence its course</span>
